                                        This remains the core of the club. Students are taught how to program in various, strong and modern programming languages. They are taught how to write re-usable which are easy to understand and comprehend by another new developers. Software development life cycle is followed. Real world projects are created and tested making members real-world project developers. Major languages focused on are PHP, Python(OOP, flask and Django) for back-end, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, for front-end, SQLite, MySQL for databases and Workbench for Relational Mappings.

                                        These include moving to different Schools around Mbarara to sensitize the communities about better computing skills, do community support and guidance ranging from teaching to cleaning up computers, setting computers on a network.
                                        Trips include visiting companies with high computing applications to study how what students have studied in class is actually applied in real world companies.
